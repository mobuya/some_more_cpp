# C++ projects | Winter22

These two project were a part of the Programing 2 Lecture at Univeristy of Vienna. The vector was an assignement where we learned about dynamic memory allocation and for the smart_pointer project they taught us how to use smart pointers and how to use the important std::move function/converter.
