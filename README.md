# C++ projects | Winter22

These two projects were integral components of the Programming 2 course at the University of Vienna. The vector assignment provided a hands-on experience with dynamic memory allocation, enhancing our understanding of efficient memory management. 

The smart pointer project introduced us to the usage of smart pointers, emphasizing their significance in modern C++ programming, and demonstrated the critical application of the std::move function for efficient resource management.
